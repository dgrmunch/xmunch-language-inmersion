# xmunch-language-inmersion

This is a toolbox to learn any language by using reading, listening and double-way real-time translation (tested with English, Spanish and Esperanto).  

## Important:

Currently it only works on Mozilla Firefox. It is still a prototype which I am using to improve my own language learning.
